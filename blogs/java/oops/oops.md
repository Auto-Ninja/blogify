> A powerful paradigm that models software around real-world entities using **classes** and **objects**.

## 🧠 What Is OOP?

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm centered around the concept of **objects**, which are instances of **classes**. These objects encapsulate both:

- **Data** (attributes)  
- **Behavior** (methods)

This promotes **modularity**, **reusability**, and **scalability** in software design.

## 🔑 Core Principles of OOP

- **Encapsulation**  
  Bundle data and methods within a class, restricting direct access to internal components.

- **Abstraction**  
  Hide complex implementation details and expose only essential features.

- **Inheritance**  
  Create new classes from existing ones to promote code reuse.

- **Polymorphism**  
  Enable entities to take on multiple forms through method overriding and dynamic behavior.

> These principles help build systems that are easier to **maintain**, **extend**, and **debug**.

## 📜 A Brief History of OOP

### 🕰️ 1960s – Birth of OOP  
**Simula 67**, developed by Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard in Norway, introduced the concept of **classes and objects**. It was originally designed for simulations.

### 🧪 1970s – Smalltalk Revolution  
**Smalltalk**, created by Alan Kay and his team at Xerox PARC, fully embraced the object-oriented model with **dynamic typing** and **message passing**.

### 🧱 1980s – C++ and Industrial Adoption  
**C++**, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, extended C with OOP features and became widely used in **systems and application programming**.
