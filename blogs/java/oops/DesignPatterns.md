## 🧠 What Are Design Patterns?
Design patterns are standardized templates for solving recurring problems in software architecture. They are not code, but conceptual solutions that can be adapted to specific programming challenges.

### ✅ Why Use Design Patterns?
- Promote reusability and reduce duplication
- Improve code readability and maintainability
- Facilitate team communication with shared vocabulary
- Speed up development by applying proven solutions
- Encourage separation of concerns and modular design

### 🧩 Types of Design Patterns
Design patterns are broadly categorized into three main types:
- 1. 🎯 Creational Patterns
Focus on object creation mechanisms.
- 2. 🏗️ Structural Patterns
Deal with object composition and relationships.
- 3. 🔄 Behavioral Patterns
Concerned with communication between objects.
