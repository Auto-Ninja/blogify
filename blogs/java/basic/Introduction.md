## ‚òï Introduction to Java
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995 (now owned by Oracle). It's known for its platform independence, meaning code written in Java can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

"Write once, run anywhere" ‚Äî Java's core philosophy.

### üìú History of Java
| Year        | Milestone                                                                 |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1991        | Java project started as "Oak" by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems       |
| 1995        | Java 1.0 released ‚Äî first public version                                   |
| 1998        | Java 2 (J2SE 1.2) introduced Swing, Collections                           |
| 2004        | Java 5 added Generics, Annotations                                         |
| 2011        | Oracle takes over Java after acquiring Sun                                 |
| 2017        | Java 9 introduces modular system (Project Jigsaw)                         |
| 2018‚ÄìPresent| Shift to 6-month release cycle for new versions                           |

### üß≠ Java Version Timeline
| Version   | Release Year | Key Features                                                 |
|-----------|-------------:|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Java 1.0  | 1995         | First stable release                                          |
| Java 5    | 2004         | Generics, Enums, Annotations                                  |
| Java 8    | 2014         | Lambda expressions, Streams                                   |
| Java 9    | 2017         | Module system (Project Jigsaw)                               |

### ‚öôÔ∏è JVM ‚Äì Java Virtual Machine
The JVM is the engine that runs Java bytecode. It abstracts the underlying hardware and OS, enabling cross-platform compatibility.

#### ‚úÖ JVM Responsibilities
- Loads and executes .class files
- Manages memory (via Garbage Collection)
- Provides security and performance optimizations

### üß∞ Java SDK vs JRE
| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| JDK (Java Development Kit) | Full toolkit for developers: compiler (javac), debugger, libraries |
| JRE (Java Runtime Environment) | Runtime-only: JVM + core libraries (no compiler) |
| SDK (Software Development Kit) | Broader term; JDK is Java's SDK |

### üñ•Ô∏è Popular Java Editors & IDEs
| Editor | Features |
|--------|----------|
| IntelliJ IDEA | Smart code completion, refactoring, debugging |
| Eclipse | Plugin-rich, enterprise-grade development |
| NetBeans | Oracle-supported, good for beginners |
| VS Code | Lightweight with Java extensions |

### üöÄ Java Runtime Environment
The JRE is what end-users install to run Java applications. It includes:

- JVM
- Core libraries
- Supporting files

Developers use the JDK, while users typically install the JRE.

### üì¶ Summary
```plaintext
Java = Language + JVM + JDK + JRE
JVM = Runs bytecode
JDK = Developer tools
JRE = Runtime for users
```
