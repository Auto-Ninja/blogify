# 📘 Chapter 3: Static Testing 
Static testing means checking software without running it. Instead of executing code, you review documents, designs, or even the code itself to find mistakes early.

## 🧠 Why Use Static Testing?
- It’s fast and cheap — you catch errors before the software is built.
- It improves quality — you fix problems in requirements, design, or code before they cause bugs.
- It helps teams communicate better — everyone understands what’s being built.

### 🍔 Real-World Example: Food Delivery App
Imagine you're building a food delivery app. Before coding:
- You review the requirements document: Does it clearly say how users place orders?
- You check the UI design: Are buttons labeled correctly? Is the flow logical?
- You inspect the code: Are there any syntax errors or logic mistakes?

All of this is static testing — no software is run, but you’re still finding issues.

## 🔍 Types of Static Testing: Reviews
Static testing is often done through reviews. These are meetings or activities where people look at work products and give feedback.

## 📋 Types of Reviews
| Review Type       | What It Is                      | Example                                                                 |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Informal Review   | Casual check, no rules          | A teammate glances at your test case and says “Looks good!”            |
| Walkthrough       | Author explains the work        | A developer walks the team through a new feature                       |
| Technical Review  | Experts give feedback           | Architects review the system design for performance                    |
| Inspection        | Formal, detailed, documented     | QA team checks code for standards and defects using a checklist        |

## 👥 Who’s Involved in Reviews?
| Role      | What They Do                     |
|-----------|----------------------------------|
| Author    | Creates the document or code     |
| Reviewer  | Checks for defects               |
| Moderator | Leads the review meeting         |
| Scribe    | Writes down issues found         |
| Manager   | Oversees the review process      |
